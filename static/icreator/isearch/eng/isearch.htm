<B><LI>Resume of the professional background. </LI></OL>

</B><P>I took up programming in 1985. I studied FORTRAN, C, Basic, FoxPro, Access, Prolog, Assembler, Pascal. I make up the System of Intelligent Search using the PROLOG. I have been making it up for a few years already.</P>
<B><LI>Information about the invention.</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Name of the technological offer.</LI>
</B><P>Intelligent (Semantic, Clever ) Searching System (search engines) for Text Information (a computer software).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><LI>Field of application.</LI>
</B><P>All the spheres of human activity, since search of information is needed everywhere. For example it may be a knowledgebase on deposits in Geology or in Oilmining, it may be a knowledgebase on types of metal treatment in Metallurgy, it may be Data Mining, it is very powerful tool in text mode databases such as medical history diseases, and so on.</P>
<B><LI>The stage of readiness.</LI>
<OL>

</B><LI>By now has been formally developed by 90% of the Intelligent Search System. About 1/3 of the System has been programmed, that is text input, search of local meaning, structure of internal databases.</LI>
<LI>It will take the group of 4-5 programmers from half a year to a year to develop a commercial product.</LI>
<B><LI>How much will cost reducing the invention to practice, starting from the moment of its being bought by a party concerned?</LI></OL>

</B><P>In Russia costs, wages of 5 programmers working on the System will be 5 x $500 x 12month = $30000. The office and computers for them will cost no more than $5000, and advertisment - whole cost will about $50000.</P>
<B><LI>The prospective list of companies, firms, corporations which, in your opinion, may take interest in your invention.</LI>
</B><P>In Russia - the internet search portals - Yandex, APORT, Rambler,…; information systems - Garant+, 1C,…</P>
<P>Private companies and purchasers.</P>
<P>In world -Yahoo, Goodle…; Microsoft, Oracle…</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><LI>Legal protections</LI>
</B><P>Copyright on formal system definition, and Copyright on source codes.</P>
<P>It should be noted that Russian law does not patent software for computers. But it does patent "methods". Should we treat the formal description of the Intelligent Search as a "method", then we may get a patent.</P>
<B><LI>Competitive advantages. What does your invention excel its analogues in?</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Conceptual and technical advantages. </LI>
</B><P>For the time being, software when searching information takes into account the coincidence of symbols in the user's inquiry and in a piece of information; the logic words "no", "either", "only" is not taken into account. The meaning of information is not taken into account at all. For example, there is a piece of information "The firm P&amp;Co sells furniture and buys wood". The user makes an inquiry about who "selling wood". The standard search engine will establish coincidence of words "sell" + "wood" and will produce information about the firm P&amp;Co which <B>"sells</B> furniture and buys <B>wood</B>". But the information is wrong. On the other hand sometimes there is no coincidence of letters but the meaning of pieces of information does coincide. The standard search system will not produce information. For example, there is a piece of information "we sell a cottage in the country". The user makes an inquiry about "a private house on sale". The words "cottage" and "house" do not coincide, so the standard system will overlook the piece of information, though it is just what one needs. The proposed System will give "we sell a cottage in the country" using the coincidence of meanings. </P>
<B><LI>Financial advantages for a producer.</LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>

</B><P>Financial advantage is that:</P>

<UL>
<LI>searching sometime in internet or in other text databases using standard search systems one may waste a day and find nothing useful. The proposed System may save your time and give useful information. So you will use your time profitable. </LI>
<LI>When using such consultation software as Garant+ in search of a consultation, one may waste much time and find nothing. The proposed System will act as a consultant-human beings. </LI>
<LI>The consultation of a specialist, for example, of a lawyer, cost much. The proposed System may serve as a consultant of a high class itself. So an enterprise need not have a crew of lawyers or pay for consultations. </LI>
<LI>For work with information, firms has to have a crew of programmers who serve database software and make up software of various forms of accounts. In our case we don't need programmers, the System acts with a user as a human being and does what the user needs. Natural language is used in the dialogue between a user and the System.</LI></UL>

<OL>

<OL>

<B><LI>Why producers will prefer exactly your invention.</LI>
</B><P>There are no other system of intelligent search on the market. There are only intentions and "intellectual search system" which are intelligent enough only to neglect the words morphology, that is to neglect their endings, and not to pay attention to "meaningless" words such as: "no", "and", "not", "on", "in", "only"… to put it simply, they are not intelligent.</P>
<B><LI>Show the prospect of your production (invention) on the market.</LI>
</B><P>Even now the informational market is crammed with various firms. They pay round sums for DataMining software which cannot provide intelligent search but which help one to sort out current information. And in future the flow of information will increase multifold, so one will have to spend days on search for necessary data and their processing. So everyone will need system capable of searching themselves necessary information and of processing them. For the time being many companies work in this direction. For example, the IBM promises to issue the software program "Lawyer Consultant" with the text interface in a natural language in four years. Everyone who owns a computer will need such programs. That is the market of such System will be like that of Windows of Microsoft.</P>
<B><LI>Will the purchase of your invention result in a drastic restructuring of a producer's enterprises?</LI>
</B><P>The adoption of the System at an enterprise will lead to no extra expenses.</P>
<B><LI>How long will it take to adept the invention at an enterprise.</LI>
</B><P>The time of the adoption of the System is the time of its filling with data. Every user wants to have his own volume of information. The datum volume of information will be introduced into the System beforehand. So the adoption as a process is nonexistent in this case.</P>
<B><LI>Computer</B> piracy may block the way to incoming profits.</LI>
<B><LI>What is risk that the markets will not adopt the invention?</LI>
</B><P>I see no risk at all. Everyone needs it - it is fact. It will be not expensive and so not risky. It is the fact too. If the level of computer hardware may not allow to use the System with the knowledgebase as large as that of a human being. It this case one must use specialized knowledgebases. For example a special knowledgebase on cars, on laws, on real estate and so on.</P>
<B><LI>Whom do you see as a prospective purchaser of the invention?</LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>


<UL>
</B><LI>large firms, before all - a novelty always cost much. The System will cost about a few thousand dollars. And it will pay its creation within a few months. Later the price will go down to a few hundred dollars which will make the System accessible to medium-size enterprises. At this stage it will give profit. Still later a user will be able to use the System through the internet or buy it for less than a hundred dollars. At this stage it will give superprofits.</LI></UL>

<OL>
<OL>
<OL>

<B><LI>What are the analogues of your invention?</LI>
</B><P>I don't know such system. Though I looked for them in the internet and visited sites of Russian Academy of Scientists.</P>
<B><LI>What are the risks for purchasers of your invention and the ways of their decrease?</LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>

</B><P>The purchaser must be protected from software pirates - so that his competitors should not get advantage of using the System free of charge.</P>
<OL>

<B><LI>Forms of co-operation</LI>
<OL>

<LI>In what form would you like to get a compensation for your invention?</LI>
</B><P>I would like to set up a new firm and to get investment into its authorized capital. A 30% of the value duly belongs to the authors of the System, that is, to me, on the basis of the intellectual property. I may also take part in the authorized capital with my money. It would be desirable that the firm-investor should be engaged in making-up and selling software. Then the question of looking for and taking on a crew of programmers can be dropped. Also the risk of informational leakage will decrease since the programmers are trust worthy. By the way, they may also get from 1% to 2% of the authorized capital to make the more interested in making up the System as soon as possible</P>
<B><LI>Did your apply to investors?</LI></OL>

</B><P>Talks are under way.</P>
